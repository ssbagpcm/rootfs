# ROOTFS + Lightweight Docker Alternative
This repository has a collection of rootfs (see releases, will update them every months)

---

Moreover, this also contains a custom lightweight alternative to Docker.

To discover it, clone the repo, and then create the files by doing : `python boxer.py setup --install` (it will install evrything you want)

Then you can see some commands by doing :

`boxer help`

This is isolated, meaning that you can remove everything on the container, and your host **WILL NOT** get damaged by it. 
Features : 

- caches and layers architecure, similar to docker
- really fast building
- autonomous code
- light-weight as hell
- easy to use
- containers buildable with a EZ file

*Have fun :)*
