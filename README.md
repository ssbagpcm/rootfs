# rootfs + lightweight docker alternative
a collection of rootfs (see releases)

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

a custom version of docker. 

To discover it, clone the repo, and then create the files by doing : `python main.py setup` (it will install evrything you want)

Then you can see some commands by doing :

`python main.py help`

This is isolated, meaning that you can remove everything on the container, and your host WILL NOT get damaged by it. 
Features : 

- caches and layers architecure, similar to docker
- really fast building
- autonomous code
- light-weight as hell
- easy to use
- containers buildable with a EZ file

Have fun :)
